1. For each problem, state its goal in your own words and describe your approach to solve the 
problem along with any issues you encountered and if/how you managed to solve those issues.

[Problem 1 (Understanding j--)]

Goal: To produce a sequence of integers, provided the starting point, stopping point, and incrementative step. 
(Not including largest number if exceding upper bounds)

Approach: I began with a brief brush-up on some Java syntax and reading the Provided Java Lite documentation.
I then tried to approach the incrementation using a for-loop and noticed some of the assignment techniques 
usually used, were not allowed. I also noticed that "<" (LT) is not allowed to be used for some reason, though the 
Java Lite documentation allows for that. To put it simply, I just swapped the conditions and the sign and the ">" worked fine.
Then I just had it print to Standard Output and that was that.
