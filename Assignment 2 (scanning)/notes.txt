1. For each problem, state its goal in your own words and describe your approach to solve the 
problem along with any issues you encountered and if/how you managed to solve those issues.

[Problem 1 (Multiline Comment)]

Goal: Add support for multiline commments in a way that allows for them to be ignored when parsing/compiling files.

Approach: Initially, I didn't fully understand the question, and went for an approach of tokenizing the multiline comment.
This gave me some difficulty because when I was running diff on the output, I noticed that it was essentially entirely
wrong. It then hit me that I should be just treating them in the same manner that we did with single line commments and
expect the compiler to ignore them. I believe the only bit of work required was in the scanner.java file, wherein I
added support in the getNextToken() function.

[Problem 2 (Reserved Words)]

Goal: Add support for certain reserved keywords so that the scanner wont overlook them or throw any error.

Approach: This one came to me a lot quicker than I was anticipating. I started off with instantly adding the reserved
words to TokenInfo.java, so that they would have a reference. I then went to Scanner.java and added them in the reserved
words hashtable with the following line: reserved.put(##reservedWordHere##.image(), ##reservedWordHere##); That seemed
to be all that I needed to do to get it working. I think it makes sense to me.

[Problem 3 (Operators)]

Goal: To add support for a selection of arithmetic operators.

Approach: This one threw me for quite a loop, as I was unsure about the implementation of the operators. I initially
began with adding the token info for the operators to TokenInfo.java and implemented the Scanner.java scanner logic
for each corresponding operator. This is where things got a bit dicey. I was having a lot of trouble compiling, and I
was pretty sure that the way I handled each operator was okay. I tried adding code to JBinaryExpression.java as well as
JConditionalExpression.java but to no avail. Then after reverting everything, I tried compiling again. I was getting
this error:

[javac] C:\Users\sawye\workspace\j--\src\jminusminus\Scanner.java:9: error: package org.javacc.jjtree does not exist
    [javac] import org.javacc.jjtree.Token;
    [javac]                         ^
    [javac] 1 error

    so what I did, was just comment out this line and It worked. I don't think that the way that it should be but I'm 
    not sure what to do. I checked with the autograder as well and it gave me credit for the question so im just not
    very sure what to do. 

[Problem 4 (Literals)]

Goal: Add support for multiple different literals (long, double, and exponents) 

Approach: I first started off by adding support in the TokenInfo.java file, and then moved over to the Scanner.java file
I was running into issues from the start, but I just started adding cases in the numerical section. I of course ran into
the same issue that I did for problem 3, so I just commented out the import again. I then started adding support for
l and L, followed by d and D and e in their normal cases. The most difficult parts, I highlight below:

The most obnoxious cases:
".0" -> DOUBLE_LITERAL
".0d" -> DOUBLE_LITERAL with 'd' suffix
".0e0" -> DOUBLE_LITERAL with exponent
".0E+0" -> DOUBLE_LITERAL with signed exponent
"." -> DOT -- standard cases

I had to edit the case '.' and that was throwing me for quite a loop. After I got the general logic down, I was able to
essentially copy and paste the other logic from the prior cases.

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how much you learned from
doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed doing it.

Quite a fun assignment, I just had those concerns about the import:

[javac] C:\Users\sawye\workspace\j--\src\jminusminus\Scanner.java:9: error: package org.javacc.jjtree does not exist
    [javac] import org.javacc.jjtree.Token;
    [javac]                         ^
    [javac] 1 error,

as it didnt concern my answers after removing it. thanks!
